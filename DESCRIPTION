Title: Translate rdf Files to RISE json Files
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: c(person("Alan", "Butler", ,"rabutler@usbr.gov", c("aut", "cre"))) 
Description: rdf2rise is a package to help translate 
    'RiverWare'(TM)<http://www.riverware.org/> "rdf"" files into the json files 
    necessary to publish data to the Reclamation Information Sharing Environment 
    (RISE). It is intended for pushing modeled (RiverWare) data that are not 
    stored in other Reclamation databases to the RISE database. It works by 
    making guesses about certain fields, so it can be used in a fully automatic 
    fashion, but allows the user to easily override those gueses in a dplyr 
    pipeline.
